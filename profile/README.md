# Gard Finance

Gard Finance is a Starknet DeFi protocol to interact with L1 DeFi protocols in a gas efficient manner. Gard Finance's goal is to be integrated directly to exisiting L1 DeFi protocols. User's will be able to use Gard directly on protocols' UI and spend less gas fees. Every 24 hours (variable) funds on the L2 pool are sent on the L1 pool and auto-compounded. User's deposits and withdrawals are grouped to make only one interaction with L1. LP tokens are emitted on L2 so user's can enter the strategy even faster by using AMMs.
