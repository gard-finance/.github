# Gard Finance

Gard Finance is a Starknet DeFi protocol to interact with L1 DeFi protocols in a gas efficient manner. Gard Finance proposes a restricted number of pools directly on Starknet. Users can deposit at any time and withdraw every day. Every day the pool will bridge the assets between the chains and deposit, withdraw and claim the fees. On Starknet liquidity providers receive LP tokens that they can exchange on AMMs so they can exit without paying the fees.
